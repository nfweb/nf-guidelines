## Act rational

>Think first, write later.

* Is this my story to share?
* Would I want my mum to read this?
* Would I want God to read this?
* Would I want this on the front page of a newspaper?

##Transient yet permanent
Social media updates are immediate and will outdate quickly BUT they can have a more lasting impact and you should assume that anything you post is permanent. Even if you delete it later on, it may have been seen and republished or referred to elsewhere.
This is especially important in regard to images and other media content: A photo online is forever. Don’t publish a picture unless you’re ready for it to exist forever online.

Social media is not fit for private conversations.

##You’re an ambassador
If you are speaking for Nightfever or about it, you will be seen in the public role as a representative of Nightfever. Make it clear that you are talking about your personal opinions and not those of Nightfever, unless you are an official spokesperson.

##Don't hide
Anonymity and ‘hiding’ behind aliases when using social media is frowned upon. On any social media platform, if you choose a username or profile different to your real name, include brief personal details in the about section.

When the account is a shared one (for example, a Facebook page) ensure people can easily find out who is responsible for the content.

##Netiquette
Be honest, polite and respectful, always. Listen to comments and responde to answers. Stay focused on the matter, don't let yourself get dragged to a personal level of discussion. If you make a mistake don't hesitate to admit and clarify it.

Never discuss internal matters in the public.

##Stay within the legal framework
Whilst sharing thoughts and reflections with friends or followers via social media can seem personal and private, it is not. By law, if one or more people can access it, content is classed as published, in the public domain and subject to legislation around libel, defamation, copyright and data protection. If you wouldn’t say something in a public meeting or to someone’s face or write it in a newspaper or on headed paper – don’t say it online.
