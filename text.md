#Encoding
Any text content should use UTF-8 encoding. This is delcared by ```<meta charset="UTF-8" />``` in the head of each page.

#Language
Any content can be available in different languages relevant to the suggested audience.
Most broader used languages have some national or regional varieties. These varieties (e.g. American English vs. British English) differ in many ways, including vocabulary (*elevator* vs. *lift*), spelling (*center* vs. *centre*), date formatting (*April 13* vs. *13 April*), and occasionally grammar (see Plurals).
The appropriate variety for any piece of content with a strong regional reference is the closest regional language variety. Within a given piece of content the conventions of one particular variety should be followed consistently.
Exceptions: quotations, proper names, titles of works.

There sould only be one language per page. The langugage is declared via ```<html lang=":lang">```.
Exceptions apply for quotations in original language, which must be declared via ```lang=":lang"``` and must be accompanied by a translation to the language of the current page.

#Orthography

##German
The german spelling is based on the rules described pursuant to an agreement between the German-speaking countries for school use ("Neue deutsche Rechtschreibung") in the current version (current as of August 2006).

#Dates
Dates should allways be written consistently.

* No leading zero for days or numerical month
* Four-digit year
* Month names should be spelled out
* If a numerical format is required, use ```YYYY-MM-DD```

Default date formats:

* German: 1. April 2014
 * content with specific reference to Austria: *Jänner* and *Feber* instead of *Januar* and *Februar*
* American English: April 1, 2014
* British English: 1 April 2014

#Time
Time of day is normally expressed in figures rather than being spelled out. Context determines whether the 12- or 24-hour clock is used.

* 12-hour clock times are written in the form ```11:15 a.m.``` and ```2:30 p.m.```, or the form ```11:15 am``` and ```2:30 pm```, with a non-breaking space  ```&nbsp;``` before the abbreviation. Use noon and midnight rather than 12 pm and 12 am.
* 24-hour clock times are written in the form ```08:15```, ```22:55```, with no suffix.

#Headlines

* Headlines are hiearchically structured, starting with second level headings (h2) for content
* Headings should not normally contain links, especially where only part of a heading is linked.
* Section and subsection headings should preferably be unique within a page.
* Headings should not contain images, including flag icons.
* Unnecessary headlines must be avoided.

#Quotations
* The wording of the quoted text should be faithfully reproduced.
* Where there is good reason to change the wording, enclose it within square brackets
* If there is a significant error in the original statement, [sic] indicates that is is original.
* Trivial spelling and typographic errors should simply be corrected without comment, unless the slip is textually important.
* The author of a quote of a full sentence or more should be named; this is done in the main text and not in a footnote.
* Quotations from foreign-language sources should appear in translation.

#Numbers
* Low value integers are spelled out in words
 * English: from zero to nine
 * German: from zero to twelve
* Decimal point
 * English: A period/full stop (never a comma): 6.57, not 6,57
 * German: A comma (never a period): 6,57, not 6.57
* Grouping of digits: Where five or more digits appear left of the decimal point, they are grouped into triples. Four digits are never grouped.
 * English: use comma (never period/full stop): 12,200, 255,200, 8,274,527, but 1024
 * German: use period (never comma): 12.200, 255.200, 8.274.527, but 1024
 * Swiss German: use apostrophe: 12'200, 255'200, 8'274'527, but 1024
