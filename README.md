#Principles of Guidelines
Uniformity increases the flow and the joy of reading, identification with the brand and cooperative working. Visitors who have become accustomed to a standard, are more likely to come back as a user, than those who need to re-orient at every visit. Then the reader can focus on the content.

In addition, these guidelines help to maintain a minimum level of quality, support unexperienced authors and help even experienced users if in doubt.

The guidelines itself should be suitable for everyday use. Consequently, it does not need a 100 pages manual or a novel read from cover to cover, but a clear and well-structured reference, with easy access to all the essentials.

#Use and Application
Use common sense in applying these guidelines. There will be occasional exceptions.
